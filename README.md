# Getting Started
This project uses IBM Skills Network Labs (SN Labs), which is a virtual lab environment. Additional setup might be required to run this locally.

# About this project
This is a Python-based AI application that leverages OpenAI's Whisper for speech transcription and IBM Watson for content summarization, integrated via a Hugging Face Gradio interface.

This project showcases the development of an advanced AI application designed to enhance the efficiency of capturing and summarizing business meetings. By integrating OpenAI's Whisper technology, the application accurately transcribes spoken content into text. It further utilizes IBM Watson's AI to analyze the transcribed text and extract key points, providing concise summaries of discussions. The entire application is made accessible through a user-friendly interface developed with Hugging Face's Gradio, ensuring that it is intuitive for users without technical backgrounds. This application not only demonstrates the practical application of cutting-edge AI technologies but also the ability to create comprehensive solutions that address real-world needs in corporate and educational settings.
